# Data Gathering from Zhang 2019

A script to aggregate sequences and results metadata from:

Zhang, Wei et al.  Identification of Variable and Joining Germline Genes and Alleles for Rhesus Macaque from B Cell Receptor Repertoires.  The Journal of Immunology, March 1, 2019, 202 (5) 1612-1622; <https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800342>

Rep-seq sequences from PBMCs were deposited in:

 * <https://db.cngb.org/search/project/CNP0000116>
 * <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA503527>

The sequence ID suffixes they used specify that a sequence is found in:

 * a: IMGT
 * b: KI (Karolinska Institutet) genome dataset, from <https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3003752>
 * c: this paper
 * d: KI IgM dataset, from <https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms13642> (The IgDiscover paper)

Tables:

 * 1: "Identified novel JH alleles in the rhesus monkey"
 * 2: "Predicted novel V genes and alleles in the rhesus macaque (mismatch >7
   bp and located at the same genome region of the previous genes)"
 * 3: "Predicted novel V genes and alleles in the rhesus macaque monkey
   (mismatch > 7 bp and located at the novel genome region)"
 * S1: Primers
 * S2: "Predicted reported and novel V alleles of Rhesus monkey (Mismatch<=7bp)"
 * S3: "MacVJ: Total Rhesus Monkey IGH germline genes and alleles, including
   IMGT, CS and our identified" (CS = Christopher Sundling = KI genome
   dataset?)
